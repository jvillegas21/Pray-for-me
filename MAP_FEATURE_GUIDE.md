## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `@rnmapbox/maps`: Mapbox React Native integration
- `@react-native-community/geolocation`: Device location access
- React Native location permissions

### Key Components

#### MapScreen.tsx
Main map interface with:
- Mapbox MapView integration
- Prayer marker rendering
- Filter and search functionality
- Location permission handling

#### MapLegend.tsx
Toggleable legend showing:
- Priority level color codes
- Category icons
- Special marker meanings

#### MapCluster.tsx
Smart clustering component for:
- Grouping nearby prayers
- Dynamic sizing based on count
- Urgency-based coloring

### Data Flow
1. **Location Request**: Ask for user permission
2. **Prayer Fetch**: Load prayers within radius
3. **Filter Application**: Apply category/search filters
4. **Map Rendering**: Display filtered prayers as markers
5. **Interaction**: Handle marker taps and detail views

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Mapbox Configuration
1. Create account at [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com)
2. Get your access token from the dashboard
3. Add to environment variables:
```env
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.your_mapbox_access_token_here
```

### 2. Platform Setup

#### Android
Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

#### iOS
Add to `ios/YourApp/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs location access to show nearby prayers.</string>
```

### 3. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install @rnmapbox/maps @react-native-community/geolocation

# For React Native 0.60+, run pod install for iOS
cd ios && pod install
```

  // ... existing categories
];
```

#### Customizing Map Styles
```typescript
// In MapScreen.tsx
<Mapbox.MapView
  styleURL={Mapbox.StyleURL.Street} // Change to other styles
  // Mapbox.StyleURL.Satellite
  // Mapbox.StyleURL.Dark
  // Custom URL for custom styles
/>
```

#### Adjusting Default Settings
```typescript
const [filters, setFilters] = useState<MapFilter>({
  category: null,
  urgency: null,
  radius: 10, // Change default radius
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Marker clustering**: Prevents overcrowding with many prayers
- **Lazy loading**: Only loads prayers in current viewport
- **Efficient filtering**: Client-side filtering for smooth UX
- **Debounced search**: Prevents excessive API calls

### Memory Management
- Markers are efficiently rendered using Mapbox native components
- Unused map tiles are automatically cleaned up
- Component state is optimized for performance

## Privacy & Security

### Location Privacy
- Location data is only used for finding nearby prayers
- No location tracking or storage
- Users can deny location permission and still use other features

### Prayer Privacy
- Only non-anonymous prayers appear on map
- Personal information is protected
- Exact locations are never stored, only general areas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Map Not Loading
1. Check Mapbox access token is valid
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check console for API errors

#### Location Not Working
1. Ensure location permissions are granted
2. Check device location services are enabled
3. Try restarting the app

#### Prayers Not Appearing
1. Check if location permission is granted
2. Verify prayers exist in selected radius
3. Check filter settings

#### Performance Issues
1. Reduce search radius if too many prayers
2. Close other apps to free memory
3. Restart app if markers don't respond

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time updates**: Live prayer status changes
- **Prayer heatmaps**: Density visualization
- **Community boundaries**: Show church/community areas
- **Offline support**: Cached prayers for offline viewing
- **Navigation**: Directions to prayer locations

### API Enhancements
- **Geospatial database**: PostGIS for efficient location queries
- **Push notifications**: Alert users to nearby urgent prayers
- **Prayer clustering**: Server-side clustering for better performance
